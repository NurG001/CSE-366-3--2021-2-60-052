# Enhanced Dynamic Robot Movement Simulation

This repository contains code for simulating the movement of a robot in a dynamic environment using various search algorithms to find the optimal path from a starting point to a destination while avoiding obstacles.
## Overview

The assignment includes implementations of two common pathfinding algorithms: A* (A-star) and Uniform Cost Search (UCS). These algorithms enable the robot to navigate the environment efficiently by finding the shortest path from the starting point to the destination while considering obstacles and battery constraints.

## Files

- `Assignment_1_Enhanced_Dynamic_Robot_Movement_Simulation.ipynb`: Defines the `Environment`,`Robot` class representing the environment grid and obstacles, robot's behaviour and movement.
  `A* and UCS` Implementations and also main script to run simulations using different search algorithms.
- `Assignment_1_Enhanced Dynamic Robot Movement Simulation Report.pdf`: Contains the Assignment Report.
- `README.md`: This file, providing an overview of the project.

## Needed:
Jupyter Notebook with libraries like matplotlib

## How to Use

1. Open the Jupyter notebook file. 

2. Follow the prompts to select the search algorithm (A* or UCS) simulation script and run to observe the robot's movement in the environment with battery constraints.

3. An assignment report is also included in this repository.
