# Genetic Algorithm - Robot Resource Optimization

## Overview
This repository contains code for optimizing task assignments among robots using `Genetic Algorithm (GA)`. The objective is to efficiently allocate tasks to robots with varying efficiencies and task priorities, aiming to minimize completion time and balance workload distribution.

## Files
- `Assignment 2 - Genetic Algorithm - Robot Resource Optimization.ipynb`: Main script for running the optimization process.
- `Assignment 2 - Genetic Algorithm - Robot Resource Optimization Report.pdf`: Containing the assignment report.
- `README.md`: This file, providing an overview of the assignment.

## Requirements
- Jupyter Notebook
- matplotlib
- numpy

## How to Use:

1. Open the Jupyter notebook file.

2. Run the main script.

3. Explore the optimization results:
- View the optimized task assignments in the generated visualization.
- Analyze the results and insights provided in the console output.

4. An assignment report is also included in this repository.
